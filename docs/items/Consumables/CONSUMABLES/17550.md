# [Limited] HD Cranium Box (30) (ID: 17550)

### Description
    A box containing 30 HD Skull [Limited].
    It has been compressed for so long that the density and solidity have been increased. It seems that Defense Weapon Enhancement becomes more difficult.
    If you fail to refine a defensive weapon whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed.
    (When refinement fails, the Refine Level drops by -1)
    This item is non-refundable.
    Weight: 1
