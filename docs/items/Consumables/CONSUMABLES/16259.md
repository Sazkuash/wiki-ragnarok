# HD Carnium Box(5) (ID: 16259)

### Description
    A box containing 5 high-density carniums.
    A high-density Carnium used in armor refinement.
    Take it to the Mighty Hammer in the Eden Group or in Payon, near the Kafra Employees, to help refine armors to +10 and higher.
    The density of this Carnium ensures that your armor will NOT break when attempting to upgrade it,
    if the refinement attempt fails, it will only drop 1 Level instead of 3 like a normal Carnium.
