# Runestaff Fragment (ID: 1000200)

### Description
    A piece of black metal, cold to the touch, that seems to absorb the surrounding light.
    It pulses with a rhythmic energy, oscillating between Law and Chaos.
    This artifact was entrusted to you by Huillam and Dorian in Izlude.
    They say it is the key to maintaining Multiversal Balance
    and find the legendary city of Tanelorn.
    Do not lose it. The fate of the worlds depends on it.
