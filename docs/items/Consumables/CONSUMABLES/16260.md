# HD Bradium Box(10) (ID: 16260)

### Description
    A box containing 10 high-density bradiums.
    The density and solidity were increased by repeated experiments by the scholars of Rune-Midgard. It seems that weapon refinement becomes more difficult.
    When you fail to refine a defense weapon whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed. (When refinement fails, the Refine Level drops -1)
