# HD Carnium Box(5) (ID: 16263)

### Description
    A box containing 5 high-density carniums.
    It was compressed for so long that the density and solidity were increased. It seems that refining Defense Equipment becomes more difficult.
    When you fail to refine a defense equipment whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed. (When refinement fails, the Refine Level drops -1)
