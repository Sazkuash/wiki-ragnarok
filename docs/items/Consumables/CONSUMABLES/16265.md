# HD Carnium Box(10) (ID: 16265)

### Description
    A box containing 10 high density craniums.
    It was compressed for so long that the density and solidity were increased. It seems that refining Defense Equipment becomes more difficult.
    When you fail to refine a defense equipment whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed. (When refinement fails, the Refine Level drops -1)
