# [Limited] HD Bradium Box (30) (ID: 17549)

### Description
    A box containing 30 Bradium HD [Limited].
    The density and solidity were increased by repeated experiments of the Rune-Midgards academics. It seems that weapon refinement becomes more difficult.
    If you fail to refine a defensive weapon whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed.
    (When refinement fails, the Refine Level drops by -1)
    This item is non-refundable.
