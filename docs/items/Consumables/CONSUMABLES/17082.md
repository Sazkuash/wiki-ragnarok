# Alora (ID: 17082)

### Description
    This hat box contains one of four new visuals based on popular hats.
    Take this box to Alora on the second floor of the Eden Group and she will allow you to choose which one you want!
    Additionally, if you refine a normal/slotted version of the equipment to +8 or higher, Alora will take it and give you a visual version of it.
    These visual versions grant +15% EXP when killing monsters until August 14, 2013, and you will lose the normal version of the equipment.
    Visual: Puppy Tiara
    Visual: Empty Eyes (no trade for +8)
    Costume: Detective Hat
    Costume: Rabbit Tiara
    The box can be traded and sold, but the head visuals are account-bound.
    Weight: 1
