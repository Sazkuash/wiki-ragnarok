# HD Bradium Box(5) (ID: 16258)

### Description
    A box containing 5 high-density bradiums.
    A high-density Bradium used in weapon refinement. Take it to the Mighty Hammer in the Eden Group or in Payon, near the Kafra Employees, to help refine weapons to +10 and higher.
    The density of this Bradium ensures that your weapon will NOT break when attempting to enhance it, and if the enhancement attempt fails, it will only drop 1 Level instead of 3 like a normal Bradium.
