# Cacao (ID: 7182)

## Description
> A nut from the Cacao tree that is naturally found in warm climates. It must be dried into cocoa beans, fried, and then ground to become cocoa paste. Chocolate is made by solidifying the cocoa paste with milk. The fat extracted from the cocoa paste is used as cocoa butter, so it is not ready to eat yet.
