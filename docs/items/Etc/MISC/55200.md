# Book of Balance (ID: 55200)

### Description
    A tome bound in an ageless material, oblivious to time.
    Its pages narrate the Eternal Champion
    the legendary city that exists beyond the war between Law and Chaos.
    The harmony of Tanelorn cannot be contained in a single being.
    It radiates from the wielder, turning individual prayers into collective hymns.
    Turns the skills Blessing and Increase Agility
    into area effects, reaching all nearby allies
    with the protection of the Multiversal Balance.
    Peace is the final desire of every weary warrior.
