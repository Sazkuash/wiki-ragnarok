# [Limited] HD Carnium (ID: 6906)

### Description
    It was compressed for so long that the density and solidity increased. It seems to make Defense Weapon Refinement more difficult.
    When you fail to refine a defense weapon whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed.
    (When enhancement fails, Refine Level decreases by -1)
    Weight: 1
