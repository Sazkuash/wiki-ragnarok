# [Limited] HD Bradium (ID: 6327)

### Description
    The density and solidity were increased by repeated experiments by Rune-Midgard scholars. It seems that it becomes more difficult for weapon refinement.
    When you fail to refine defense equipment whose Refine Level is higher than +10, it will not be destroyed.
    (When enhancement fails, Refine Level decreases by -1)
    Weight: 1
