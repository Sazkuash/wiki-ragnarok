# HD Bradium (ID: 6226)

### Description
    A high-density Bradium used to refine weapons. Take it to the Mighty Hammer in the Eden Group or in Payon next to the Kafra Ladies to help refine weapons to +10 or higher.
    The density of this Bradium guarantees that your weapon will NOT be broken when attempting to refine, and if the refinement attempt fails, it will only regress 1 Level instead of 3, like a normal Bradium.
    Type: Forging Material
    Weight: 1
