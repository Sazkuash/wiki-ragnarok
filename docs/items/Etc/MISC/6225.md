# HD Carnium (ID: 6225)

### Description
    A high-density Carnium used to refine armor. Take it to the Mighty Hammer in the Eden Group or in Payon next to the Kafra Ladies to help refine armor to +10 or higher.
    The density of this Carnium ensures that your armor will NOT be broken when attempting to refine, and if the refinement attempt fails, it will only regress 1 Level instead of 3, like a normal Carnium.
    Type: Forging Material
    Weight: 1
